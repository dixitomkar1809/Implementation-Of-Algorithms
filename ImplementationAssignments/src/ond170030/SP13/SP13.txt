Short Project 13: String algorithms
Fri, Nov 30, 2018

Version 1.0: Initial description (Fri, Nov 30).

There is no team task.  SP13 is optional (individual).
Solve 0 or more problems.

Due: 11:59 PM, Sun, Dec 16.

1. Implement Tries.  Starter code is provided.
   You may modify the methods and parameters (even for public methods), as needed.

2. Implement KMP algorithm.  Use it to solve the following problem:
   Given a string s, find the shortest string x such that x + s is a palindrome.

3. Implement Boyer-Moore algorithm.

4. Implement automata matcher.
